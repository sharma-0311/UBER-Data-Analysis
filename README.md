# UBER-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber trip data to gain insights into trip patterns, distance trends, and trip purposes. The goal is to understand user behavior, identify travel trends, and optimize ride-sharing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains Uber ride details, including:
- **START_DATE**: Timestamp when the trip started
- **END_DATE**: Timestamp when the trip ended
- **CATEGORY**: Classification of the trip (Business/Personal)
- **START**: Starting location
- **STOP**: Destination location
- **MILES**: Distance traveled during the trip
- **PURPOSE**: Reason for the trip (e.g., Meeting, Customer Visit, Errand/Supplies)

## Objectives
- Analyze trip distribution over time.
- Identify peak travel times and locations.
- Determine the most common trip purposes.
- Examine distance trends for different trip categories.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data processing and analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Power BI / Tableau**: Interactive dashboards (optional)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Running and testing the analysis

## Steps for Analysis
1. **Data Collection**: Import and load the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, standardize timestamps, and remove inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify key patterns and trends.
4. **Visualization**: Generate graphs and charts to represent insights.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/uber-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd uber-data-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform analysis:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Results & Insights
- Peak travel hours are identified based on trip timestamps.
- The most frequent trip purposes are **Meeting** and **Customer Visit**.
- Business trips tend to cover longer distances compared to personal trips.
- Short trips (under 5 miles) are common within the same city, whereas longer trips are often inter-city.

## Future Enhancements
- Predict trip purposes using machine learning.
- Analyze cost factors and fare trends (if available).
- Incorporate real-time Uber ride data for dynamic analysis.
